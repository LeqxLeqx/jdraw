# jdraw
A simple 2d drawing library for java

# To compile:
first, edit `build.sh` such that the variable `JMATH_JAR` points to the location of your jmath jar file. See `build.sh` for details. Then simply run `./build.sh`

# Regarding jdraw.overlay
this package is not well coded and will either be upgraded significantly or depricated in the near future. I would not recomend using this package with the expectation
that it will remain either present or unchanged in later versions
